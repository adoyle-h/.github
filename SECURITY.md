  * Type of issue. (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue.
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL).
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue.
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code. (if possible)
